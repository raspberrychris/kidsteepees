### Customers Say about this product

>  "I have been looking at various children's teepees for quite some time trying to find a good quality one without having to pay an extortionate amount of money. I'm delighted I finally found this one. Its a good, large size, it easily fits two children. My child is four, and this will last for several more years size wise. Its made from good quality, thick cotton, which feels like linen, so it won't rip. It holds it shape perfectly because of its design. Its a blank canvas so to speak, which I'm very happy with as we can decorate it how we want or just leave it blank. I would definitely recommend it."

### Customers Say about this product

>  "This Teepee ticks all the boxes for an easy to put together indoor/ outdoor children,s play tent to enjoy hours of fun. The fold away poles go together and slide easily into the sleeves to support the tent, 4 pegs for erecting on the grass to secure firmly. A colourful tent that on wet days will amuse the kids indoors and comes supplied with a comfortable fitted mattress which is soft on the top and waterproof base. Not only safe from the sun,s rays there are ventilation holes to let the air circulate on hot days. A far cry from my childhood days of throwing an old blanket over four dining chairs lol. Made slightly larger than some tents we have bought it gives the children a little more room. The tent packs away neatly into it,s own carry bag. I have no hesitation in giving a 5 STAR rating and think it is priced about right.""

### Pros and Cons

| ✅  Pros | ❌ Cons |
|-|-|
| 👉 Well Packaged and easy to assemble|👉 Not a 'pop up' tent   |

However there is a mark on the material at the front of the tent and the mattress is not waterproof it is just the same material as the tent. Apart from this I would recommend the tent as it is very sturdy and has plenty of room inside."

>  "Love it!.. I ordered the off-white, and got exactly what I was looking for.

The off-white has the bottom connected, the white does not. The off-white has five sides, the white has four .. I got the off-white, with 5 sides, and the bottom connected and it is exactly what I hoped for."
