## What is a Teepee?

The teepee is a traditional Native American dwelling that has been used for centuries. Teepees are made of animal skins or blankets, and they can be set up on the ground in an open space, or even raised off it with poles to make them easier reachable from all sides if you want your tent outside long-term.  For most Kids Teepees they tend to be made from fabric and  are a lot easier to set up and take down.

Teepees are traditionally used for camping, but they can also be made into playhouses or even bedrooms if you want your kids' room that has an Indian theme!  If it's just going in the back garden then you might want to consider whether it needs to be waterproof.

## Teepees are Popular with Children

Teepees are one of the most popular structures for kids to play in. They're easy to set up and they provide a great space for playtime! But what happens when the winds start blowing? The teepee might collapse, which can be frustrating and hazardous. There's no need to worry though- there are some important steps you can take that will keep your teepees standing strong. Keep reading below to learn more about how you can stop them from collapsing!

## Teepee Structure and design

Teepees are made of poles and a cover. The top is usually open, but it can be closed with the use or ropes to keep out rainwater if you want your teepee outside for an extended period of time (or even permanently). Teepees should only have one opening at ground level so that they don't collapse under their own weight when someone climbs in through another entrance! This also helps prevent water from getting inside during storms too.  

## How to stop a Teepee from collapsing

Is there a good way to stop them from collapsing? Yes! Tie some rope around each pole about halfway up its height before setting anything else on there; this will help stabilise everything as well provide extra support against any sudden gusts of wind by adding tension between all four corners.

## Other top tips for helping to stop your teepee from collapsing:

## 1. Take the time to assemble it correctly

It is important to take the time when assembling your teepee and make sure it's done correctly. You want all of its poles in a straight line, so that they are supporting each other as well as providing stability.

## 2. Choose a sturdy base for your teepee

The best material for the foundation of any tent is wood. You want it to be sturdy and able to hold up with heavy use. Wood will always be the best choice as it won't get mouldy or rot like plastic would over time. There are also many different types of wood that can be used from cedar, oak, pine, etc., so there's plenty of options out there!  

You might need a stronger or more durable piece of material than just plywood if you use your teepee outdoors often, since outdoor weather conditions like rain can eventually cause the tent to collapse.

## 3. Make sure you have enough space in your garden and that there are no trees nearby

It's important to make sure that you have enough space in your garden for the teepee and there are no trees nearby. You don't want any branches or leaves getting caught on it while they're playing, which could cause a collapse!  It is also best if children can play inside of their tent without fear from being hit by anything

## 4. Avoid using stakes or rocks as support, which can cause damage to the fabric when they fall over

It's best to avoid using stakes or rocks as support, which can cause damage. They are not strong enough and they will eventually fall over onto the fabric of your teepee causing it some serious harm.
