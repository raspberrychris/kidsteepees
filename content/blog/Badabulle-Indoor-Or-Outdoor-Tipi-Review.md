### Customers Say about this product

>  "This Teepee ticks all the boxes for an easy to put together indoor/ outdoor children,s play tent to enjoy hours of fun. The fold away poles go together and slide easily into the sleeves to support the tent, 4 pegs for erecting on the grass to secure firmly. A colourful tent that on wet days will amuse the kids indoors and comes supplied with a comfortable fitted mattress which is soft on the top and waterproof base. Not only safe from the sun,s rays there are ventilation holes to let the air circulate on hot days. A far cry from my childhood days of throwing an old blanket over four dining chairs lol. Made slightly larger than some tents we have bought it gives the children a little more room. The tent packs away neatly into it,s own carry bag. I have no hesitation in giving a 5 STAR rating and think it is priced about right.""
