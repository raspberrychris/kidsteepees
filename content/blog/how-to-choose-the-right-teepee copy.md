> Choosing the perfect teepee for your little one can be a daunting task. There are so many designs and colours to choose from! The good news is that there are some easy ways to find the right one for you.

## Consider the size of your child

Consider the size of your child. The teepee should be big enough for them to stand up in and have room left over, but not so large that they can't play inside it comfortably with their friends or siblings! If you're looking at a design where there are different sizes available (such as "small" vs."medium"), try out both options before making an informed decision about which one is best suited towards how much space will work well within this type of tent structure . You may find yourself surprised by what works better than expected when trying these two designs on side by side! Remember also if someone else might want use too, like grandparents who live far away from home...they'll need something larger then just  a small teepee for their little one.

## Measure your child

The best way to find the right size is by measuring your child and then looking at what sizes are available in that design . If you're not sure of how much space they need, it's always a good idea just go with something bigger than smaller.  

## Don't buy a teepee that is too big or too small

If the teepee is too small, it's not going to be comfortable for your child and they'll want out of there as soon a possible. It will also make them feel claustrophobic which can lead to anxiety issues if you have an anxious little one on hand.

## Go for a good quality teepee

A good quality teepee can really become an extra special present, a poor one can fall down and cause disappointment (or even injury).

If you're looking for a teepee that will last, it's important to find one with quality materials and stitching. The best way is by checking the reviews of other parents who have already purchased this product before making your final decision .  If there are any complaints about how long their child has been using theirs or if they've had issues because something was broken from day two then I would recommend finding another design!  It might be worth spending more money on an item like these so when your little one grows up they can use it as a bedroom decoration instead just throwing away after only six months. If you are considering this option it might be best to look for something durable and long-lasting (which I know all parents are!) then go with canvas or cotton fabric because those materials won't rip easily when pulled by children who love climbing in them . Also make sure there isn’t any stitching coming undone from day two - this could lead into bigger problems later down line such at falling out threads which may cause injury ! If possible try not have anything too pointy sticking off either side and go with canvas or cotton fabric because those materials won't rip easily when pulled by children who love climbing in them.

## Weight provides security for active children

I also recommend looking for something that has a little bit of weight to it, so your child can feel secure and safe inside the tent - this is especially important if you have an active toddler! Lastly make sure there's enough room at both ends (or one end) where they will be able find their way out without getting stuck on anything pointy sticking off either side; we don’t want any injuries here! If possible, try not having too much space around sides as well-this could lead into bigger problems later down line such like falling threads which may cause injury .

I would suggest finding an option made from durable material or canvas if you have children who are rough players because this is going make sure there's no tearing in case someone falls onto them while playing outside - kids love climbing all over things!
