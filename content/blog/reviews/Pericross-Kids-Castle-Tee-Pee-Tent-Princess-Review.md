### Customers Say about this product

>  "A dream for any little princess, especially if you actually hang a starry light chain.
Nice and airy through the curtains; otherwise I'll find the air jams up quickly with more than one child in the play tent. Despite the lack of instructions, easy to set up. So four stars for this!""
