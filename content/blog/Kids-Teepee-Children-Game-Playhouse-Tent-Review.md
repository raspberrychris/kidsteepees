### Customers Say about this product

>  "I bought the teepee for my two year old grandson. It looks really good and he is very pleased with it. However there is a mark on the material at the front of the tent and the mattress is not waterproof it is just the same material as the tent. Apart from this I would recommend the tent as it is very sturdy and has plenty of room inside."
