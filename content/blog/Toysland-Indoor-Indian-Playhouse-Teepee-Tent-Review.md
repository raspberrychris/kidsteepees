### Customers Say about this product

>  "Love it!.. I ordered the off-white, and got exactly what I was looking for. Reading other reviews and some stating it had a bottom and some stating it didn't, I was worried, but I also paid close attention to detail, and noticed the differences are the colours you order. The off-white has the bottom connected, the white does not. The off-white has five sides, the white has four .. I got the off-white, with 5 sides, and the bottom connected and it is exactly what I hoped for."
