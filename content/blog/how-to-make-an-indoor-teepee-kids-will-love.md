Kids love to play in teepees! In this post, we will show you how to make an indoor teepee for kids that they'll love. You don't need a sewing machine or any complicated tools, just some fabric and a few other supplies.

We're going to give you step-by-step instructions so it's really easy. And the best part is, once you've made one of these fun crafts your kids will be begging for more!

## Instructions:

## Step 1

Gather your supplies. You'll need a large sheet of fabric, a sewing machine or needle and thread (or you can use glue), scissors to cut the pieces out of it if using paper templates like we did in our video tutorial below) , pins for securing everything together while stitching them up with either hand-sewing needles/threads OR hot gluing gun . If not doing this project as an indoor teepee then grab something else that will be sturdy enough--like PVC pipes! In addition make sure there is plenty room on all sides because kids love climbing inside.

## Step 2

Cut the fabric into pieces that will form the teepee's four walls and floor. The floor should be the largest piece, and then cut two of each for all four walls.

After cutting out your pieces you'll need to sew them together with either a sewing machine or needle/threads OR hot glue gun (if not doing this as an indoor teepee). You can use pins while stitching up everything if using paper templates.

The next step is optional but recommended! Use fabric paint on one side so that kids have plenty room inside, or even better yet they could decorate their own teepee by painting both sides before assembling into tent shape which would make great arts & crafts project too! If making indoors just fold over edges inwards.

## Step 3

Sew together all four pieces, leaving an opening at one end for your child to crawl inside and out again.

## Step 4

Place the teepee in a corner of your living room or bedroom so it doesn't take up too much space.
